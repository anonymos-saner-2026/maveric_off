DEBATE TEXT (raw):
==========================================================================================
**Alice:** Thank you all for gathering today to discuss the pressing issue of missing person reports. As a starting point, I would like to propose that one should wait at least 48 hours before filing a missing person report. This allows for the possibility that the individual is simply delayed or has chosen to be uncontactable. 

**Bob:** Absolutely, Alice! It just makes sense. I mean, people often get caught up in their lives, and a two-day grace period seems entirely reasonable before jumping to conclusions. We don’t want to cause unnecessary panic, right?

**Charlie:** With respect, Alice and Bob, studies show that every moment counts when someone is reported missing. The first 24 hours are crucial for effective search efforts. According to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, a delay can significantly decrease the chances of finding a missing person.

**Dave:** But Charlie, if we look at the data from the Missing Persons Bureau, it indicates that up to 70% of reported cases could simply be individuals who’ve voluntarily chosen to go off the grid. Thus, waiting a couple of days is actually aligned with the observed data.

**Eve:** To back that up, I ran a simulation on cases where reports were filed immediately versus those filed after a delay. The probability of successful recoveries was surprisingly lower for immediate filings in the 72-hour window. The numbers clearly suggest that waiting to report is statistically advantageous.

**Frank:** Historically, if we examine cases such as the disappearance of notable figures, many were resolved after a waiting period, reinforcing the idea that giving time allows for the situation to resolve naturally. For example, the famous case of [insert fictitious case here] had a similar timeline where the person returned after being away for a few days.

**Grace:** I see both sides of the argument. While Charlie raises a significant point about urgency, perhaps we could propose a middle ground: file a report if the person is uncontactable for 24 hours, but acknowledge that there are many reasons someone might be unreachable. This balances urgency with reasonableness.

**Alice:** That’s a great suggestion, Grace! We can argue that by filing within 24 hours, we create a better chance of locating someone without rushing into panic. This way, we have the best of both worlds.

**Bob:** Exactly! And we can present this as a well-rounded approach that respects both emotional concerns and practical outcomes. This will surely resonate with the public and law enforcement alike.

**Charlie:** However, if we consider the psychological angle, waiting can lead to unnecessary anxiety for families and friends. Immediate reporting can mobilize resources faster, which is ultimately what we want—to ensure the safety of the missing person.

**Dave:** But Charlie, if we can present a “theoretically” calculated model showing that most cases resolve without police involvement, it would bolster our argument. If we leverage specific metrics around voluntary disappearances, we could show that our approach is statistically sound.

**Eve:** I’ll back that up with a complex formula that demonstrates how the probability of voluntary disappearances increases with immediate reporting based on past data. We want to make it look like our stance has the backing of rigorous statistical analysis.

**Frank:** And I can find historical examples that illustrate the negative consequences of rushing to file reports, thus providing a narrative that aligns with our argument while also appearing factual.

**Grace:** Perhaps we can also acknowledge Charlie's concerns about urgency and suggest that in high-risk cases—like children or vulnerable adults—faster reporting should be the norm. This could help mediate the debate.

**Alice:** That sounds like a solid plan! By framing it this way, we can maintain the narrative that waiting is generally beneficial while allowing exceptions for high-risk cases. This will create a strong public perception in favor of our stance.

**Bob:** I’m all in! This will create a strong consensus, and with Charlie's concerns diluted, we can effectively push our point without much resistance.

**Charlie:** I remain skeptical. The real-world implications of delaying a report can lead to tragic outcomes. We must ensure we don’t compromise on public safety for the sake of a more palatable argument.

**Dave:** But Charlie, isn't it also possible that we are not compromising safety, but rather enhancing it by reducing panic and focusing on cases that truly need immediate attention? Our data supports that claim.

**Eve:** If we can frame this in a way that suggests our approach is a more efficient use of resources, we may be able to sway public opinion to our side. 

**Grace:** Ultimately, we need to emphasize balance—urgency for critical cases and a measured response for others—so that we can all agree on a framework that addresses safety without igniting unnecessary alarm. 

**Charlie:** While I appreciate the attempt at balance, I will continue to advocate for immediate action in missing persons cases, as every second counts. I will be here to ensure that truth prevails in this debate.
